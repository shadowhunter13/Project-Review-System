The Project Review System is a Java-based application developed to simplify and digitalize the evaluation process of student or organizational projects. It provides an organized platform where project details can be submitted, reviewed, and assessed by faculty or supervisors. The system supports features such as project registration, reviewer allocation, scoring based on defined parameters, and generating structured feedback for improvement.

Implemented using Java (Core/Advanced) and integrated with a database (such as MySQL or Oracle), the system ensures secure data handling and scalability. The user interface allows reviewers to log in, view assigned projects, and provide evaluations, while project teams can track their progress and feedback transparently.

Key features include:

Project submission and record management

Allocation of reviewers or faculty for assessments

Evaluation with scoring criteria and comments

Generating consolidated reports for performance tracking

Secure authentication for students and reviewers

By automating the review process, the system reduces manual effort, improves transparency, and ensures systematic project evaluation, making it highly useful in academic institutions and organizations for efficient project monitoring.
